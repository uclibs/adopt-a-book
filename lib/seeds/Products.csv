Henry Lansdell (1841-1919) was a noted explorer who often traveled in Asia to distribute his religious tracts and chronicled his experiences along the way. It seemed he always courted controversy, however. He once was arrested in Russia because it was thought he was carrying pamphlets about revolution. Similar to his other books on Siberia and Russia Central Asia, this two-volume work contains colorful accounts of his travels (crossing the vast Asian deserts, perhaps as the first Englishman to do so) sometimes on a horse, sometimes on a yak.

Currently only seven copies of the work are held in the U.S. The excerpt below suggests how some physicians used the charts. In treating malignancy, it is essential to have a well-developed routine procedure to apply to cases of any general type, and subject to modification to meet the exigencies of the individual case. The object is to deliver an accurate and, as nearly as possible, an adequate dosage into the parts involved. When the pelvis or a similar part of the trunk is involved, it is our custom now to make a perimetric outline drawing of the part and to draw into it, from a projected lantern slide made from one of Desjardins' cross section charts, the outlines of the various anatomic structures found therein.

At the time Paré entered the French army, surgeons treated gunshot wounds with boiling oil. On one occasion, when Paré’s supply of oil ran out, he treated the wounds with a mixture of egg yolk, rose oil, and turpentine, and found that the wounds treated with this mixture healed better than those treated with the oil.
